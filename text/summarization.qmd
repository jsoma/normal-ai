## Use cases

When you want to summarize something, clearly!

An excellent *other* use case is sending context to tools like ChatGPT to get answers from. These tools have limited amounts of text they can read, so you can't say "here's a whole book, do my homework." What you *can* do is summarize each chapter of the book, send it to ChatGPT and say "here are the chapter summaries, do my homework" (or maybe, "what chapter do I need to read?" and then send it that chapter).
