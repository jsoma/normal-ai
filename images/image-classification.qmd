Image classification allows you to put images into category. Typically these are yes/no questions.

* Does this satellite image show illegal mining operations?
* Does this photograph have a car in it?
* Does this x-ray show a broken bone?

Custom image classifiers are simple to build yourself! You can visit the [build your own image classifier page](../diy/image-classification.qmd) for more details.

Image classifiers are on the simpler end of the visual analysis spectrum. More advanced models can show exactly where things are in an image (e.g. vegetation, swimming pools), or segment out those individual things (e.g. cars, people).
