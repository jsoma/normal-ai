There are a handful of different ways that computers can look at images, and one of the options is "stuff" versus "things." Instance segmentation can be used to find "things:" each individual person, car, tree, etc in an image.

## Use cases

Instance segmentation is great at answering the question of "is XXXX in this photo?" You can think of it as an image classification model with a little bit more nuance.

You might want to filter thousands of photos to only show the ones that include a car or an elephant, or count the number of people in the image of a crowd.

Instance segmentation also shows you *where* in the image something is, which may or may not be useful.

## Try it out
